# Hello there 👋!
## My Name is Raffael ! 😁
I'm a Videographer, Photograph and 3D Artist, who also likes to code.
I'm currently studying Media informatics in Germany at the environmental campus birkenfeld. 
I really enjoy learning new stuff, and I'm trying to get better at coding.
## My current Projects
- [Lebot] a small mini games bot for Discord
- [Cyberium] a high tech Terraia mod for tModLoader
- [CoronaZahlenMonitor] a small website which shows the daily covid-19 cases in Germany
